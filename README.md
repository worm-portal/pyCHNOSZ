# pyCHNOSZ

Author: Dr. Grayson Boyer, GEOPIG Lab, Arizona State University

This is a python wrapper for certain functions in the R package [CHNOSZ](https://www.chnosz.net/) by Dr. Jeffrey Dick.

## Features

Currently, the following CHNOSZ functions are supported in pyCHNOSZ:

- [info](https://chnosz.net/manual/info.html) - Search for chemical species by name or formula and retrieve their thermodynamic parameters.
- [subcrt](https://chnosz.net/manual/subcrt.html) - Calculate standard state partial molal thermodynamic properties of reactions at elevated temperatures and pressures.

## Requirements

This package must be installed into an environment that has an [R](https://www.r-project.org/) installation. See [these instructions](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/tasks/using-r-language/) for installing R with Anaconda. Additionally, the CHNOSZ package for R must be installed (see instructions below).

## Installation

### Installing CHNOSZ

Open an R session. Install the CHNOSZ package with:

```r
install.packages("CHNOSZ")
```

Once CHNOSZ is installed you may quit the R session.

### Installing pyCHNOSZ

Install pyCHNOSZ using pip:

```
$ pip install pyCHNOSZ
```

## Usage

### Search for chemical species

The `info` function can be used to look up chemical species by name or formula. If names or formulas are provided, database index integers are returned. A list of integers will look up chemical species by index and return a table of thermodynamic properties. See the `info` function's [original documentation](https://chnosz.net/manual/info.html) to learn more about what this function can do. A few examples are shown below.

Look up the database index value of Fe+2:

```python
info("Fe+2")
```

Look up multiple chemical species:

```python
info(["HCO3-", "CH4"])
```

Define chemical states:

```python
info(["HCO3-", "CH4"], state=["aq", "gas"])
```

Search species by index values to look up their thermodynamic parameters.

```python
info([13, 872])
```

Nest `info` functions to look up thermodynamic properties directly from names or formulas:

```python
info(info("Fe+2"))
```

Look up and add a protein to the database:

```python
info("LYSC_CHICK")
```

### Calculate thermodynamic properties of reactions

See the [original documentation](https://chnosz.net/manual/subcrt.html) for `subcrt`. Useage in pyCHNOSZ is the same, except python lists are used in place of R's vectors. The function produces a dictionary of results stored in pandas dataframes. An example is shown below for the reaction H<sub>2 (aq)</sub> + 0.5 O<sub>2 (gas)</sub> = H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(liq)</sub> at 30 and 50 degrees C and 100 bars pressure:

```python
subcrt(species=["H2", "O2", "H2O"], coeff=[-1.0, -0.5, 1.0],
       state=["aq", "gas", "liq"], T=[30, 50], P=100)
```

Output is a python dictionary of dataframes:
```
subcrt: 3 species at 2 values of T (ÂºC) and P (bar) (wet) [energy units: cal]

{'reaction':       coeff    name formula state  ispecies
