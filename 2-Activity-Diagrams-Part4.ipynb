    "- Why don't some of the mineral saturation lines in our plot match perfectly with Fig 8A from Dick 2021? For example, the vertical saturation line for cuprite appears at log(*a*<sub>Cu<sup>+</sup></sub>/*a*<sub>H<sup>+</sup></sub>) = 1.35 in our plot, but it looks more like 1.75 in Fig 8A. This is because Dick 2021 uses the OBIGT (\"One Big Table\") thermodynamic database that primarily uses minerals from [Helgeson et al., 1978](http://www.dewcommunity.org/uploads/4/1/7/6/41765907/helgeson_et_al_1978.pdf) while also mixing in minerals from [Berman 1988](https://doi.org/10.1093/petrology/29.2.445) that have their own specialized set of equations of state. The WORM database used in this demo does not include minerals from Berman 1988 in order to maintain internally consistent mineral properties.\n",
